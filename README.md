# Deep-Learning
Contains all the projects that are built using deep learning models and frameworks

## Car Price Prediction Model
Added a Python file that models a simple Linear Regression model built on a deep neural network that predicts the price of a second hand car based on the other independent variables on the dataset.

## Diabetes Prediction Model
Added a Jupyter file that creates a feedforward neural network model that takes a dataset on diabetes (PIMA India Diabetes) and predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on the independent variables given.

## Wine Reviews(Recurrent) Model
Added a Jupyter file that creates a text classification model using Recurrent Neural Network and classifies the wine reviews
